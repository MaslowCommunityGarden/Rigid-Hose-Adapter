# Rigid Hose Adapter
A dust hose adapter and strain relief for the Rigid router


I accidently had been using [this](https://www.homedepot.com/p/RIDGID-1-1-4-in-1-7-8-in-x-7-ft-Tug-A-Long-Vacuum-Hose-for-RIDGID-Wet-Dry-Vacs-VT1720/202077240) 1-1/4 inch dust collector hose which has an adapter to fit the Ridgid router, but when I went to buy a second one I accidently bought the [2-1/2 inch version](https://www.homedepot.com/p/RIDGID-2-1-2-in-x-7-ft-Tug-A-Long-Vacuum-Hose-for-RIDGID-Wet-Dry-Vacs-VT2520/100016791) instead which doesn't include an adapter.

Rather than buy an adapter (which didn't work that well anyway) I decided to cut my own. I also added an extra strain relief system which attaches the hose directly to the sled.

I've been using it for a couple months now and I've been really happy with it so far. The air flow through the 2-1/2 inch pip is substantially better than it was through the 1-1/4 version, and it has yet to clog.

I had to tweak the size of the parts to get the press fit I was looking for.
